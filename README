========================================================================================================================

This is the dependencies parent pom for all facegov dependencies. The only point of these modules is to declare
  dependencies as a convenience to other POMs that want those same dependencies

Here are what the various modules are for:

deps-api:

  DAO framework code and utility classes. Instead of this minimal DAO framework will be possible to add Spring Data JPA dependencies.

deps-hibernate:

  Various Hibernate-, transaction- and ORM-related dependencies.

deps-jpa:

  Various dependencies for Spring Data JPA.

deps-skin:

  A common skin that we use across all the facegov web site via the Maven WAR plugin's overlay
  mechanism. See http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html for more info on this.

deps-web:

  Web-related dependencies.
